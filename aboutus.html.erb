Cooking as a family activity is fun and can be surprisingly quick. In fact, preparing a satisfying meal or dessert from scratch can take less time than dining out. The time it takes to decide where to eat, get everyone ready, drive there and be seated, order and finally eat, takes much longer than you think. The time could be better spent with your loved ones with everyone helping to get the food on the table. Another benefit of scratch cooking is that it allows you to better control the types of ingredients you consume. </p>
